<!-- 
1. Define structural vs semantic meaning in regard to HTML elements.
Structural meaning refers to changing the structure of your webpage, but not conveying any further meaning beyond that. 
Semantic meaning is the opposite. This type of meaning conveys a further meaning by using an element. Using strong text in your website
is an example of this. Although strong text looks identical to bold text, strong text will have an emphasis with screen readers whereas bold text will not. 

2. Why is it important to use correct html elements when designing web pages?
It is important to use correct HTML elements when designing web pages as they help make the web page more user-friendly. For instance, it is better to have a main aspect of your website
(such as the name) as a heading instead of as a paragraph. Although both of these help convey the same information, the heading is more likely to get seen and focused on by users, and helps
to better organize the contents of your website.

3. What are forms in html? What is their purpose? When would you use one?
Forms allow for user data-collection within a website. You do this by using the <form> tag, and they take on several different forms (checkboxes, text box submissions, multiple choice, etc.)

4. Define and contrast inline vs block elements.
Block elements (such as heading and paragraph elements) will always sit on a new line.
Inline elements (such as image, or bold text ) differ, as they do not start on a new line.
