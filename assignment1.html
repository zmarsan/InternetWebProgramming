<!-- Question 1: What happens from the time a user puts a URL into their browser to when they are able to view a webpage? - Briefly define ISP, URL, DNS, web server
After typing the URL into a browser, the computer will contact a DNS server. 
After this, a request gets sent to the host of the website, which is called a web server. 
Once these steps are completed the user will be able to reach the page they are looking for.

An ISP is short for an Internet Service Provider. This is something that allows a user to access the internet and visit different websites.
URL is short for a Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address to the resource that the user is trying to access.
DNS is short for a Domain Name System. This helps the user access the internet, giving your computer information such as the IP address of the domain name.
A Web Server is a computer that is always connected to the web, sending the requested page to a person's browser and further allowing them to access the internet.  


Question #2: What is HTML? What does it do? 
HTML stands for "HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE," and it is the standard language for creating web pages. By using angled brackets, the language helps to design different webpages, 
including elements such as different headings, lists, links, etc. 


Question #3: Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user. 

Fordham's webpage utilizes structure to convey meaning in several ways. For starters, the website utilizes a heading at the very top of the page stating "FORDHAM UNIVERSITY..." in order to showcase that this is Fordham University's website.
It additionally provides links to different stories that are relavent to the college, allowing users to explore recent news about it. In the drop down menu, there are different headings and subheadings that help direct users specifically to 
the part of the website that they are trying to reach. 

Question #4: What is an HTML element? Tag? Attribute?
A HTML element is something that is surrounded in opening and close tags (<>, </>) that help structure a web page. For instance, you can have a heading element, or a paragraph element which adds text to your web page. 
A HTML tag is used to open and close an element. For instance, an opening tag would be "<p>" and a closing tag would be "</p>"
A HTML attribute provides extra information about an element. For instance, you can use attributes to change the color or size of text, and CSS comes into play here as well.
