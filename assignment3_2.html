3. Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border:
Margins are used in CSS to create specified amounts of space around the HTML elements in your website.
Padding is similar, but is used in CSS to specify amounts of space INSIDE of an HTML element.
Border works with margins and padding, but is the line or shape that contains the HTML element. You can make your borders be red, for instance.
   
These all help to generally structure a website, and work together with their key differences to do so.

4. Define the following flexbox css rules

a) display: flex: This creates a flex container, and allows children to be able to be moved within the container.
b) flex direction: This establishes the direction of your flex container. You would use this if you wanted your items in a vertical column, for instance.  
c) flex-wrap: This allows items to wrap around each other rather than organize in one direction.
d) justify-content/align items: Helps to align items within the container when there is extra available space - align-items helps to do this same thing but verically 
e) align-content: Works similarly to align items, but does this when there is extra space in the cross axis.
